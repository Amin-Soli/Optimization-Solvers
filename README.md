# This program has been written in the form of Object-Oriented Programming in C++ (Class).

# This program calculates the minimum of Rosenbrock function with two different methods.

# Two different methods consist of Newton-Raphson method and Steepest Descent method including constant step size, variable step size and quadratic Fi.

# This program consists of three folders: 
  One folder which is named "libs", includes all required classes to solve the problem
  One folder which is named "solver", includes your main code file ("main.cpp") 
  Another folder which is named "inputData", includes "inputData.txt" file to enter required data for solving the problem 

# If you want to run this program, all you need to do is:
  1. Go to "inputData" folder
  2. Open "inputData.txt" file and enter required data 
  3. Go to "solver" folder
  4. Compile "main.cpp" file and then run
